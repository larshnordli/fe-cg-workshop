# Workshop for Front-end CG for September '22
React 18 app with React Router 6, Pico.css and Vite.
## Getting started
Clone or fork this repo and branch and
1. `npm install` to install deps
2. `npm run dev` to run dev server

Vite config is not set up to run tests or build code. You are free to do so, but it should not be necessary in order to follow workshop.
