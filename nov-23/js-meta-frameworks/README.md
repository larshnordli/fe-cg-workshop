# JS Meta-Frameworks

## Assignments
1. Research the web (and/or use [the resources](#resources)) to compile a list in a notepad doc or similar of at least five JS Meta-Frameworks including
    - Main features and "selling points"
    - How popular it is (stars on GitHub, community size, active development/releases etc.)
    - What JS framework or technology is being used
2. Choose *at least one* meta-framework, and use their "Getting started" guide to display the compiled list in 1 (note: `npm init` is already run in this directory). Either pick one [by random](https://www.random.org/lists/) or weigh your options against one another using your list.
3. If your chosen meta-framework supports and you have time, try to implement some form of hydration
