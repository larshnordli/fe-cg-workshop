# JS Meta-Frameworks

## Assignments
1. Research the web (and/or use [the resources](#resources)) to compile a list in a notepad doc or similar of at least five JS Meta-Frameworks including
    - Main features and "selling points"
    - How popular it is (stars on GitHub, community size, active development/releases etc.)
    - What JS framework or technology is being used
2. Choose *one* meta-framework and use their "Getting started" guide to display the compiled list in 1 (note: `npm init` is already run in this directory, but you can delete `package.json`-file if the guide calls for `npx` or similar). Either pick one [by random](https://www.random.org/lists/) or weigh your options against one another using your list.
    2.1. Instead of a list, you could make a comparsion table of them
3. If your chosen meta-framework supports it and you have time, try to implement some form of hydration (note: this might require some time to understand and to set up an example)
