# End-to-end testing with Playwright

## Getting started
1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run test` to run Playwright tests and use this command to do assignments

## Assignments
1. This repo includes one failing test. Use [Playwright Docs](https://playwright.dev/docs/writing-tests) to edit the test so that is passes.
2. Write a test that clicks the link on the page and verify that text input when following that link is disabled. Use [Playwright "Running tests" Docs](https://playwright.dev/docs/running-tests) to guide the process. Make sure to include UI Mode, headed mode and multiple agents in the process (even on a successful test)
3. Use [Codegen feature](https://playwright.dev/docs/codegen-intro) to write a test that verifies that enabling the text field with the checkbox enables a user to write something.

## Dev environment
Dev environment is setup of [Getting startet with Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro).

Example and demo files are replaced with assignment specific tests. Tests are run towards a simple HTML page.
