# End-to-end testing with Cypress

## Getting started
1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm cypress:open` to open Cypress Launchpad to do the assignments

## Assignments
1. Use instructions in [Cypress Docs](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/end-to-end-testing/writing-your-first-end-to-end-test) to create a passing and failing test using Cypress Launchpad.
2. When you get to ["Write a real test"](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/end-to-end-testing/writing-your-first-end-to-end-test#Write-a-real-test) you *can* substitute the testing link with the simple assignment web page ([https://larshnordli.github.io](https://larshnordli.github.io)), or follow the guide. If you choose to use testing link, write a test that clicks the link on the page and verify that text input when following that link is disabled.
3. Use [Cypress Studio feature](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/cypress-studio) to record a test that verifies that enabling the text field with the checkbox enables a user to write something.

## Dev environment
Dev environment is setup of [Installing Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress). End-to-end testing is preset.

Example and demo files are replaced with assignment specific tests. Tests are run towards a simple HTML page.
